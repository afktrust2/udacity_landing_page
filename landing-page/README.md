## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

-added text-
This project was to make a dynamic navigation bar that interacted with the page and highlighted the section which the reader is on. The navigation bar will have four hyperlinks that will scroll the page to the section the user wants to look at and highlight that section with a darker background. After the user is done and moves on to the next sections, the page will stop highlighting that section and highlight the current one.
